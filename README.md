# Folder Subdivider

A simple Python script to organise large folders into smaller subfolders, each containing a set number of files.

ðŸ“‚ Useful for:
- Research projects with many reference images or PDFs
- OSINT investigations with downloaded files
- Digital forensics or data review work
- Keeping your folders clean and manageable

---

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

Give it a folder with (say) 300 files, and it splits it into neat subfolders:
/my-folder/ â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder_1/ â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder_2/ â””â”€â”€ subfolder_3/

Each subfolder will contain up to 100 files (or whatever number you choose).
